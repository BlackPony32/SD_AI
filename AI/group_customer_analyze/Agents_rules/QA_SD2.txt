### **Q: Can I manage different price lists for different customers?**
**A:** Yes. SimplyDepo supports **Custom Pricing & Price Lists**. You can assign specific pricing tiers, volume discounts, or contract prices to individual customers or customer groups (e.g., "Wholesale VIP" vs. "Standard Retail").

### **Q: What is "Lot Tracking"?**
**A:** For perishable CPG goods, Lot Tracking allows businesses to trace specific batches of products (lots) through the supply chain. This is crucial for managing expiration dates (FEFO - First Expired, First Out) and handling recalls efficiently.


## 4. Logistics & Order Fulfillment

### **Q: What is Proof of Delivery (POD)?**
**A:** Proof of Delivery is a method used to establish that the recipient received the contents sent by the sender.
**In SimplyDepo:** Drivers and field reps can capture electronic signatures, take photos of delivered goods, or scan barcodes at the drop-off point. This digital POD is instantly uploaded to the system to resolve disputes and speed up invoicing.

### **Q: How are Backorders handled?**
**A:** A Backorder occurs when a specific quantity of an item cannot be filled by the current available inventory.
**In SimplyDepo:** The system automatically flags out-of-stock items during order entry. It allows reps to either create a separate "backorder" to be fulfilled later or substitute the item, ensuring the customer knows exactly what will be delivered immediately versus later.

### **Q: What is Reverse Logistics (Returns Management)?**
**A:** Reverse Logistics refers to the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal.
**In SimplyDepo:** The platform streamlines **Returns Management (RMA)** by allowing reps to process returns on-site, issue credit notes instantly, and update inventory levels to reflect returned stock (whether it’s damaged or restockable).

### **Q: What are Recurring Orders?**
**A:** Recurring Orders are standing orders set to repeat at specific intervals (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).
**In SimplyDepo:** Sales managers can set up automated recurring orders for loyal customers with predictable demand. This ensures consistent revenue and reduces the manual administrative work for sales reps during routine visits.

### **Q: What is Last Mile Delivery?**
**A:** Last Mile Delivery is the final step of the delivery process—moving a package from a transportation hub to the final destination (the retail store or customer).
**In SimplyDepo:** The **Route Optimization** and **Driver App** features are specifically designed to optimize this expensive stage of logistics by calculating the fastest routes and providing real-time tracking updates.

## 5. Retail Metrics & Merchandising Terms

### **Q: What is a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)?**
**A:** A SKU is a unique code used to identify and track inventory levels for a specific product.
**In SimplyDepo:** The platform uses SKUs to manage the entire product catalog, tracking variations such as flavor, size, and packaging type to ensure accurate ordering and reporting.

### **Q: What does "Facings" mean in retail execution?**
**A:** "Facings" refers to the number of identical products placed side-by-side on a retail shelf, visible to the customer.
**In SimplyDepo:** Merchandisers record the number of facings during store audits. This data helps brands determine if they are getting the shelf space they paid for and how their visibility compares to competitors.

### **Q: What is Share of Shelf (SOS)?**
**A:** Share of Shelf is a metric that compares the amount of space a specific brand occupies on a store shelf relative to the total space available for that category.
**In SimplyDepo:** By logging shelf data and photos, the system can help calculate SOS, giving brands insight into their market dominance in specific retail locations.

### **Q: What is OOS (Out of Stock)?**

**In SimplyDepo:** Field reps track OOS instances during visits. This data is critical for **Demand Planning**, helping manufacturers understand lost revenue opportunities and adjust supply chain velocity.

## 6. Technical & Strategic Features

### **Q: What is Sales Forecasting?**
**A:** Sales Forecasting is the process of estimating future sales.
**In SimplyDepo:** The platform uses historical data (past orders, seasonal trends, and current growth rates) to generate forecasts. This helps distributors purchase the right amount of stock and helps brands plan production schedules effectively.

### **Q: What is EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)?**
**A:** EDI is the computer-to-computer exchange of business documents in a standard electronic format between business partners.
**In SimplyDepo:** The platform supports EDI to automate the exchange of Purchase Orders (850), Invoices (810), and Advance Ship Notices (856) with large retail partners who require this standard.

### **Q: How does Barcoding / RFID integration work?**
**A:** Barcoding and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) are technologies used for automatic data capture.
**In SimplyDepo:** The mobile app allows users to use their device's camera or a connected scanner to scan product barcodes for instant order entry, inventory lookups, and warehouse picking, significantly reducing human error.

### **Q: What is Territory Management?**
**A:** Territory Management involves dividing a sales market into segments (based on geography, sales potential, or history) to assign to specific sales reps.
**In SimplyDepo:** Managers can digitally draw territories on a map and assign customers to specific reps. This prevents sales overlap (two reps visiting the same client) and ensures balanced workloads across the team.

### **Q: What is a Fill Rate?**
**A:** Fill Rate measures the percentage of customer demand that is met through immediate stock availability, without backorders or lost sales.
**In SimplyDepo:** This is a key KPI tracked in the dashboard to measure the efficiency of the supply chain and the reliability of the distributor.
