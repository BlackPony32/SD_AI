Discount advice block list:
1) Compare discount penetration by customer segment (repeat vs. new)
Track what percentage of repeat customers receive full discounts versus new ones. Insights often show repeat buyers receive more manufacturer and loyalty-style discounts, which may signal tailored pricing.

2) Analyze discount share by discount type relative to order value
For example, if “Other Discounts” make up 68% of total discount spend, that structure may dominate cost and warrant scrutiny .

3) Flag low-usage discount types for program rationalization
Types used in fewer than X orders (e.g. invoice discounts appear in only 11 orders) may not be cost-effective or may need reengineering.

4) Evaluate margin risk from discount offerings
Estimating profit erosion per discount type (e.g. threshold vs item-based) helps identify if certain promo styles reduce margins disproportionately.

5) Compare revenue lift vs margin cost for discounts
Use simple elasticity metrics: if discount volume increases 25% but gross margin shrinks 15%, assess whether the trade-off is justified.

6) Identify discount stacking and concurrency risk
Multiple discount types applied together increase margin leakage. It’s useful to flag orders with overlapping “invoice + item + manufacturer” discounts for review.

7) Segment orders by price elasticity sensitivity
Discount response differs by product/customer; some SKU categories need discounts to move, others don’t.

8) Assess whether discounts correlate with inventory clearing
Heavy discount usage may be clearing slow-moving stock—but if applied to high-turn items, that may signal overuse.

9) Tag discount types by customer count impact
Manufacturer discounts reaching many buyers may indicate systematic negotiated pricing; limited distribution discounts may be one-off or niche.

10) Measure long-term effects: do discount recipients repeat and convert?
Recipients of item or “other” discounts can be tracked to see if they become loyal repeat customers or one-time bargain behavior.



Overall Total Sales by Payment and Delivery Status advice block list:
Sales Recovery & Revenue Capture Insights
1) Convert “PENDING” Sales into Paid and Delivered
Target unpaid but fulfilled and unfulfilled pending orders with follow-up communication to speed up cash collection and delivery.

2) Recover Lost Sales from PAID but UNFULFILLED Orders
Prioritize $X of revenue where payment is complete but delivery is pending—prevent churn and maintain satisfaction.

3) Resolve PARTIALLY PAID Orders to Boost Completion
Identify orders that are partially paid and attempt to complete authorization or retry payment to maximize revenue capture.

4) Cut Post-Delivery Refunds in Fulfilled Orders
Investigate why fulfilled orders get refunded ($Y value) and implement quality assurance to minimize this leakage. 

Fulfillment-Payment Alignment & Risk Mitigation
5) Flag PAID + UNFULFILLED Orders as High-Risk
Any completed payment with pending or no fulfillment is a service risk and should be fast-tracked to fulfillment or escalation. (link 

6) Minimize Pending & Unfulfilled Overhang

Pending and unfulfilled orders tie up cash and inventory—escalate older orders for action to reduce backlogs.

7) Apply Credit Holds or Fulfillment Blocks for Delinquent Payments
For customers with unpaid or partial payment status, hold future fulfillment to manage financial exposure until clearance.


Checkout & Payment Flow Optimization
8) Simplify Payment Retry Flows for Partial Failures

Embed retry options directly in checkout or order pages, with fast feedback loops and optional incentives to complete the payment. 

9) Reduce Checkout Friction Across Payment and Delivery Options
Use guest checkout, one-click payment, clear fee-display, and diverse payment methods (including local/cash-on-delivery where applicable) to reduce drop-offs. 

 Supply & Fulfillment Interface Improvements
10) Streamline Partial-Fulfillment Logic

Use “ship complete” or line-level fulfillment controls to avoid holding orders indefinitely if only parts of them are available—close and create new partial orders as needed.



Payment Status Analysis advice block list:
1. Segment Pending orders by age buckets (e.g. < 1 day, 1–3 days, 3–7 days, > 7 days)
Prioritize follow‑up workflows based on how long orders have stayed in the PENDING state — so you intercept stalled payment older orders sooner. Aging buckets also guide escalation cadence and automation thresholds. 

2. Automate a tiered reminder sequence (email/SMS/WhatsApp)
Trigger gentle payment reminders immediately when an order enters PENDING, then again at key intervals (e.g. 24 h, 72 h, 7 d). Testing shows this reduces unconfirmed payments and cuts down manual outreach time by over 50 % within months.

3. Recover failed payment attempts with retry rules and auto‑update logic
Analyze why payments fail — expired card, bank decline, fraud hold — and automate retry logic or use a card account updater to convert recoverable failures. That alone can recover 2–5 % of pending orders as PAID. 

4. Reduce checkout friction with multiple payment options and guest checkout
Offer a mix of credit cards, digital wallets, mobile pay, and local payment rails, and allow guest checkout. E-commerce research shows even a single checkout friction (e.g. forced login or missing payment method) increases PENDING ratios. 


7. Refine refund and partial-payment flows to prevent circular status
Design refund logic so that once a refund is finalized (even if partial), the order goes into REFUNDED or PAID rather than lingering as PENDING. Fast, clear refund handling lowers status ambiguity and helps downstream reporting and customer clarity. 


8. Audit fraud and dispute rules to avoid false declines
False positives in fraud filters often block legitimate payments, leaving orders stuck as PENDING. Regularly review blocked payment patterns and adjust rules to reduce friction while maintaining security and low chargeback rates. 

9. Use predictive analytics to forecast conversion likelihood
Train a model to score pending orders on their probability to convert and trigger pre‑emptive actions (e.g. personal agent call, offering time-limited incentives). Subscription businesses using this method have reached > 96 % recovery on renewals. 


10. Conduct quarterly operational reviews of payments stack
Every 3–6 months, audit your payment providers, retry policies, decline codes, reminder workflows, and KPIs. Identify outdated rules, test new gateway features, and update retry thresholds to keep conversion performance optimized. 


Delivery Fees Analysis advice block list:
1) Compare fee‑to‑order‑value ratio separately for “paid but not delivered” orders to spot where delivery surcharges or retry overhead pushes average fee too high — even after payment. Fee-to-sales ratios above benchmarks often point to address or courier cost friction. 

2) Flag orders with multiple delivery attempts in the “PAID but undelivered” segment—each extra attempt tends to double logistic costs. Providers estimate costs of €14 each retry, impacting both fee absorption and customer satisfaction. 


3) Embed volumetric‑weight logic in fulfillment tooling: if packaging size inflates the chargeable weight above actual weight, fees rise disproportionately. Optimizing dimensions can significantly drop costs—even on already paid orders. 

4) Track shipping fee volatility by region or postal zone—especially where calculated fees vary widely from actual lane cost. Replacing broad “one‑size” rates with zone‑based static brackets (e.g. using flat‑rate plugins) smooths out spikes. 

5) Offer (and measure take‑rate for) a local pickup alternative—orders in central or urban zones paid online but unfulfilled could save the full delivery fee if pickup is faster and cheaper. Pickup options cut logistic costs and shift the burden. 

6) Allow partial delivery as a customer option: if large multi-item orders carry high fees, delivering items in phases (e.g. ready-stock vs pre‑order items) lets customers pay only for the first leg and cancel the rest if needed. This is especially useful in the “paid but delayed” subset. 

7) Tag repeat‑buyer segments and apply implicit fee waivers or reductions: many paid-but-not-delivered orders come from loyal customers. Using shipping credit from past behavior preserves goodwill without off‑cycle margin bleed. 

8) Consolidate items into single shipments when multiple packages go to the same address: fees per order drop significantly when multiple orders consolidated; applies whether customer has paid or not. Direct consolidation can save up to 20% on per-order shipping costs. 

9) After a paid order fails delivery, review courier contracts to capture penalties (e.g. free repeat attempts or automated recovery credit) so the company doesn’t absorb every surcharge without recourse. Source data around typical retry costs (~€14) can guide contract clauses. 

10) Make address validation mandatory at checkout—roughly 20% of failed deliveries are due to input/address errors. Reducing these errors lowers both delivery fee write‑offs and refund volume in the paid-but-not-delivered bucket. 


Fulfillment Analysis advice block list:
1) Ensure real‑time inventory sync across channels and warehouses to stop “phantom availability” (items shown in stock but actually unavailable), which is a common cause of UNFULFILLED orders.

2) Forecast demand and implement safety‑stock policies per SKU and warehouse so replenishment keeps pace with variability—avoiding stockouts that drive UNFULFILLED rates.

3) Minimize picking and packing inaccuracies by optimizing strategies such as zone‑picking, batch picking or pick‑to‑light tools—errors here often lead to orders getting canceled or delayed.

4) Identify SKUs with long or unreliable supplier lead times and proactively flag them in your unfulfilled queue so backorders are managed more predictably.

5) Enable partial shipment handling so when part of an order is available, the rest ships later—this prevents an entire order from being marked UNFULFILLED for a few missing items.

6) Use fulfillment‑policy rules or fill‑rate thresholds (e.g. don’t hold an order if < 50% of lines are in stock) to balance customer experience with inventory constraints.

7) Prioritize the oldest unfulfilled orders (e.g. > X days stuck) to reduce stale backlog and surface priority cases for resolution.

8) Integrate order and inventory systems across channels (web, POS, marketplaces, warehouses) so one SKU isn't mistakenly committed to multiple.

9) Optimize inventory across fulfillment nodes using multi‑echelon logic (It’s also used in inventory and supply chains:

Products move from central warehouses (top echelon) → to regional centers (middle echelon) → to local stores (bottom echelon).

Each level only stores what it needs and relies on the one above it to supply more.

Why businesses use echelon logic:
Clear roles and responsibilities.
Easier to manage resources.
Better flow of information and goods.),
so slow-moving stock in one location can be fulfilled by nearby nodes with available supply, reducing local unfulfillment.


Sales Performance Overview advice block list:
1) Pareto logic in business is the idea that a small part of the causes creates most of the results — often explained by the 80/20 rule:

80% of outcomes come from 20% of inputs.
Example:
80% of your sales may come from 20% of your customers.
80% of problems may come from 20% of issues.
How businesses use it:
Identify the “vital few” — the small number of factors (products, clients, problems) that have the biggest impact.
Focus effort there — because improving or protecting those areas gives the highest return.
Avoid wasting time on the “trivial many” — things that take effort but don’t move the needle much.
It’s not always exactly 80/20, but the principle is about imbalance — most results come from a small share of causes.

2) Monitor Month-over-Month Volatility Triggers
If sales change by ±100% month-over-month, automatically tag it as “volatility event” for deeper enrichment (e.g. promo, bulk order, data error).

3) Track Std Dev Trends alongside Avg Revenue
A rising standard deviation even as revenue stays flat signals increasing fragmentation in customer value—plan strategy accordingly.

4) Associate AOV Variance with CLV Cohorts
Segment by estimated CLV (via RFM) and compute AOV vs Std Dev within each.
High-AOV, low-variance segments usually represent profitable, stable customer groups. 

5) Check for Promotional or One-Off Spikes
Match the timing of unusually high AOV orders with marketing activities or one-off bulk orders—helps distinguish sustainable growth from episodic peaks. 

6) Apply an Outlier-Adjusted Rolling Average
Compute a trimmed rolling average (exclude values in top and bottom 5%) to smooth noise.
This aids in trend detection and prevents high-variance orders from triggering false early-warning flags. 
Optimum



Selling Product advice block list:
1) Flag revenue concentration risk when a single product contributes > X% (e.g. 50%) of all sales
Such dominance heightens sensitivity to any drop in demand or supply issues for that SKU.

2) Segment SKUs via ABC analysis (A‑high, B‑mid, C‑low performers)
Top-sellers should be prioritized for coverage and rewards; low-sellers (like the Ginger Shot) categorized for rational review (Shopify 

3) Flag minimal‑reach products (< 2–3 buyers) for customer-fit evaluation
A SKU sold to just one customer is likely niche, mispriced, or mis‑marketed and deserves attention.

4) Trigger customer‑segmented cross‑sell recommendations to non‑buying accounts
For each high‑revenue SKU, propose to non‑buyers based on similar account profiles (e.g. those served by the top 7 buyers)

5) If no direct cross-sell exists, analyze co‑purchase across other SKUs for substitution or bundling potential
Even if “no similar products” yet, you may find cross-sell candidates via customer history patterns.

6) Evaluate worst‑sellers for product‑market fit failure
Consider relevancy, pricing, quality feedback, or misalignment with buyer need.

7) Recommend product diversification into adjacent SKUs or categories
To reduce over-reliance, enrich the product line with compatible or premium variations

8) For low‑selling SKUs, test reactive bundling under performant(?) SKUs
Present ginger shot as “add-on” with ascasc12 to drive trial without discounting core SKU margin.

9) Track repeat‑rate & AOV per product for clustering customer types
Customers buying top product are likely different in order size and frequency than pick SOGO curious, but this knowledge informs targeting logic.

10) Automatically validate large‑volume high-performing SKUs for inventory or logistic risk
High volume means high fill/batch risk; monitor return rates or fulfillment errors tied to that SKU.
